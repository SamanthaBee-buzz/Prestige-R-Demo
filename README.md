"Prestige of Canadian Occupations" is the dataset I used. I found it here https://www.john-fox.ca/AppliedRegression/datasets/index.html. The dataset and description of its variables are on the 13th row. The data itself is Prestige.txt and the description is Prestige.pdf. The dataset compiled the average years of education, average income, percent of women, occupational codes, and the type of occupation from volume 3, part 6 of the 1971 Canada census. It also included the Pineo-Porter prestige score for each occupation, which came from a 1960s survey.
My goal is to get some insight on how people view certain careers (its prestige score) and why.
